First, the program uses 
the get_user_location() 
function to determine 
the user's current 
location based on their IP.
If the geographic coordinates 
are obtained, the function 
returns them along with 
the city name.

Then the program uses 
the get_aurora_data() 
function to check 
whether the aurora 
borealis is visible at 
that location.
This function uses an API 
that returns the kp value 
(aurora activity index)
and on this basis determines 
whether the aurora 
is visible in a given area.

Next program uses the 
haversine() function 
to calculate the distance 
between the user's geographic 
coordinates and other known 
locations where the aurora 
borealis may be visible 
(e.g., Fairbanks, Alaska).
Based on the calculated 
distance, the program 
can suggest the user 
the closest location 
where the aurora is 
visible and allow him 
to open a live broadcast.
